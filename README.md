## Overview

The Kubernetes Orchestrator allows for the remote management of certificate stores defined in a Kubernetes cluster. 
The following types of Kubernetes resources are supported: kubernetes secrets of `kubernetes.io/tls` or `Opaque` and 
kubernetes certificates `certificates.k8s.io/v1`

The certificate store types that can be managed in the current version are:
- `K8SCert` - Kubernetes certificates of type `certificates.k8s.io/v1`
- `K8SSecret` - Kubernetes secrets of type `Opaque`
- `K8STLSSecret` - Kubernetes secrets of type `kubernetes.io/tls`
- `K8SCluster` - This allows for a single store to manage a k8s cluster's secrets or type `Opaque` and `kubernetes.io/tls`.
  This can be thought of as a container of `K8SSecret` and `K8STLSSecret` stores across all k8s namespaces.
- `K8SNS` - This allows for a single store to manage a k8s namespace's secrets or type `Opaque` and `kubernetes.io/tls`.
  This can be thought of as a container of `K8SSecret` and `K8STLSSecret` stores for a single k8s namespace.
- `K8SJKS` - Kubernetes secrets of type `Opaque` that contain one or more Java Keystore(s). These cannot be managed at the
  cluster or namespace level as they should all require unique credentials.
- `K8SPKCS12` - Kubernetes secrets of type `Opaque` that contain one or more PKCS12(s). These cannot be managed at the
  cluster or namespace level as they should all require unique credentials.

This orchestrator extension makes use of the Kubernetes API by using a service account
to communicate remotely with certificate stores. The service account must have the correct permissions
in order to perform the desired operations.  For more information on the required permissions, see the
[service account setup guide](#service-account-setup).

The Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension implements 7 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to use one, or all of these Certificate Store Types. Descriptions of each are provided below.

### K8SCert

The `K8SCert` store type is used to manage Kubernetes certificates of type `certificates.k8s.io/v1`. 

**NOTE**: only `inventory` and `discovery` of these resources is supported with this extension. To provision these certs use the 
[k8s-csr-signer](https://github.com/Keyfactor/k8s-csr-signer).

<details><summary>K8SJKS (K8SJKS)</summary>


### K8SJKS

The `K8SJKS` store type is used to manage Kubernetes secrets of type `Opaque`.  These secrets
must have a field that ends in `.jks`. The orchestrator will inventory and manage using a *custom alias* of the following
pattern: `<k8s_secret_field_name>/<keystore_alias>`.  For example, if the secret has a field named `mykeystore.jks` and
the keystore contains a certificate with an alias of `mycert`, the orchestrator will manage the certificate using the
alias `mykeystore.jks/mycert`. *NOTE* *This store type cannot be managed at the `cluster` or `namespace` level as they 
should all require unique credentials.*

### K8SPKCS12

The `K8SPKCS12` store type is used to manage Kubernetes secrets of type `Opaque`.  These secrets
must have a field that ends in `.pkcs12`. The orchestrator will inventory and manage using a *custom alias* of the following
pattern: `<k8s_secret_field_name>/<keystore_alias>`.  For example, if the secret has a field named `mykeystore.pkcs12` and
the keystore contains a certificate with an alias of `mycert`, the orchestrator will manage the certificate using the
alias `mykeystore.pkcs12/mycert`. *NOTE* *This store type cannot be managed at the `cluster` or `namespace` level as they
should all require unique credentials.*

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 12.4 and later.

## Support
The Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket by either contacting your Keyfactor representative or via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com. 
 
> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


### Kubernetes API Access
This orchestrator extension makes use of the Kubernetes API by using a service account
to communicate remotely with certificate stores. The service account must exist and have the appropriate permissions.
The service account token can be provided to the extension in one of two ways:
- As a raw JSON file that contains the service account credentials
- As a base64 encoded string that contains the service account credentials

#### Service Account Setup
To set up a service account user on your Kubernetes cluster to be used by the Kubernetes Orchestrator Extension. For full 
information on the required permissions, see the [service account setup guide](./scripts/kubernetes/README.md).


## Create Certificate Store Types

To use the Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the Certificate Store Types required for your usecase. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.

The Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension implements 7 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to use one, or all of these Certificate Store Types.

## Installation

1. **Download the latest Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.** 

    Navigate to the [Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/k8s-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.
    | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `k8s-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` | 
    | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `k8s-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `k8s-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The Kubernetes Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplemented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).

## Discovering Certificate Stores with the Discovery Job
**NOTE:** To use discovery jobs, you must have the story type created in Keyfactor Command and the `needs_server` 
checkbox *MUST* be checked, if you do not select `needs_server` you will not be able to provide credentials to the 
discovery job and it will fail.

The Kubernetes Orchestrator Extension supports certificate discovery jobs.  This allows you to populate the certificate stores with existing certificates.  To run a discovery job, follow these steps:
1. Click on the "Locations > Certificate Stores" menu item.
2. Click the "Discover" tab.
3. Click the "Schedule" button.
4. Configure the job based on storetype. **Note** the "Server Username" field must be set to `kubeconfig` and the "Server Password" field is the `kubeconfig` formatted JSON file containing the service account credentials.  See the "Service Account Setup" section earlier in this README for more information on setting up a service account.

   ![discover_server_username.png](./docs/screenshots/discovery/discover_server_username.png)
   ![discover_server_password.png](./docs/screenshots/discovery/discover_server_password.png)
5. Click the "Save" button and wait for the Orchestrator to run the job. This may take some time depending on the number of certificates in the store and the Orchestrator's check-in schedule.
